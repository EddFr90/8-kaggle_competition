## A detailed exploratory data analysis and regression models guide with House Price

#### This is a notebook for a kaggle competition [House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
#### This notebook is a step by step analysis from data mining to feature selection and modeling in order to solve House Pricing with Advanced Regression Analysis.
#### 7 regression Algorithms were used in this notebook:
##### - Ridge regressor
##### - Lasso regressor
##### - ElasticNet regressor
##### - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
##### - XGBoost regressor
##### - LightGBM regressor
#### R-squared (RÂ²) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are the two metrics that were used to evaluate the models.
#### The data set can be found in this link: [train and test data set](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

#### All the steps from data mining to modeling are in this same notebook. This notebook was inspired from some of the kernels in the same competition as well as other sources and machine learning tutorials:
